# react-native-is-maestro

This React Native library provides a way to detect synchronously if the app is currently running in an E2E test environment with [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev). It can be useful for disabling certain functionality or UI elements that may interfere with the test. To use the library, simply import it and call the `isMaestro()` function.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-is-maestro
yarn add react-native-is-maestro # RN 0.71 and above
```

## Auto-linking
```sh
cd ios && pod install
```

## Usage
```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native'
import { isMaestro } from 'react-native-is-maestro'

export const App = () => (
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text>
            isMaestro detected: {isMaestro() ? 'yes' : 'no'}
        </Text>
    </View>
)

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center'
    }
})
```
